- title: Student, MSc Applied Physics @ Delft University of Technology, NL
  from: 2020
  to: present
  description: I am on a 2 year Master's programme at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), fully funded under the <b>QuTech Scholarship</b>.
               Recently, I joined a research group @ QuTech, namely the Borregaard Group, where I will be working on my Master's thesis, which 
               is about quantum communication. In particular, I will be looking into how hybrid protocols involving quantum error correction code 
               concatenation and entanglement purification can improve the performance of 3rd generation quantum repeaters.

- title: Student, BSc Applied Physics @ City University of Hong Kong, HK
  from: 2017
  to: 2020
  description: I spent 3 years in City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) under the prestigious <b>HKSAR Top Scholarship</b>
               studying both applied physics (major) and computer science (minor). In addition, I spent 3 months on an
               internship in McGill University, CA as well as 6 months on an exchange to KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SE.
               My final year project in CityUHK involves computational electromagnetism, and with my supervisor and co-workers' help
               the associated work has been published on a reputable journal. Finally, I was able to graduate with a <b>first class honours</b>.

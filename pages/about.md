# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am from Malaysia but I have lived and studied in Hong Kong, Canada, Sweden, and now I am studying in The Netherlands. I love using computational physics to solve difficult problems because the challenge of coming up with an optimised code excites me and being able to see and analyse tangible results is incredibly satisfying. When I am not doing physics, I love to hike, take pictures, drink coffee and do more coding :).

## Preliminary

This post assumes that the reader has some prior knowledge about quantum error correction and quantum computing in general, and thus if you are not well acquainted with it, it might be hard to grasp what is being explained. If you wish to get acquainted, I _highly_ recommend the _superb_ introductory guide to quantum error correction by [@Roffe2019].

The desire the write this post was spurred by the fruitful discussion I had yesterday with my colleagues on a paper that I'm working on.

## The \[\[5,1,3\]\] quantum error correcting code

TODO: Show the logical states explicitly.

TODO: Show the stabiliser generators explicitly.

TODO: Mention upcoming post.

An arbitrary logical state in the \[\[5,1,3\]\] quantum error correcting code a.k.a the 5-qubit code, first shown by [@Laflamme1996], is given by the linear superposition of the logical states $|0_\mathrm{L}\rangle$ and $|1_\mathrm{L}\rangle$

$$
\begin{equation}
|\psi_\mathrm{L}\rangle
=
\alpha|0_\mathrm{L}\rangle+\beta|1_\mathrm{L}\rangle,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}$ and $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$. Note that this is a highly entangled state. Its density matrix is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_\mathrm{L}=|\psi_\mathrm{L}\rangle\!\langle\psi_\mathrm{L}|,
\end{equation}
$$

which is a pure state, i.e., $\mathrm{tr}(\rho_\mathrm{L}^2)=1$. We can rewrite it by factoring the first qubit out

$$
\begin{align}
\rho_\mathrm{L}&=\ket{0}|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|\bra{0}+
\ket{0}|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|\bra{1}+\nonumber\\
&\phantom{{}={}}\ket{1}|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|\bra{0}+\ket{1}|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|\bra{1},
\label{eqn:pure-density-matrix}
\end{align}
$$

If we have an arbitary Pauli error acting on the first qubit, then we simply write the resulting density matrix as the following

$$
\begin{align}
\rho_{\mathrm{\mathcal{E}}}&=\mathcal{E}\ket{0}|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|\bra{0}\mathcal{E}+\mathcal{E}\ket{0}|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|\bra{1}\mathcal{E}+\nonumber\\
&\phantom{{}={}}\mathcal{E}\ket{1}|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|\bra{0}\mathcal{E}+\mathcal{E}\ket{1}|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|\bra{1}\mathcal{E}\nonumber\\
&=\mathcal{E}\rho_{\mathrm{L}}\mathcal{E},
\label{eqn:error-pure-density-matrix}
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian unitary matrix which represents the rotation of the qubit's Bloch vector by some arbitrary amounts and around some arbitrary axis, i.e., an arbitrary single qubit Pauli error. Note that $\rho_{\mathrm{\mathcal{E}}}$ is still a pure state, i.e., $\mathrm{tr}(\rho_{\mathrm{\mathcal{E}}}^2)=1$.

Now imagine we have an erasure error on the first qubit, and then we replace the lost qubit with a qubit in state $|0\rangle$, the resulting density matrix would become

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lost-density-matrix}
\rho_\mathrm{lost}=\ket{0}|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|\bra{0}+\ket{0}|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|\bra{0},
\end{equation}
$$

From eqns ($\ref{eqn:pure-density-matrix}$) and ($\ref{eqn:lost-density-matrix}$), we can see that there exist no combinations of single-qubit Paulis that can bring us from state $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ to $\rho_\mathrm{lost}$. In fact, there exists no unitaries that can do that, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:neq-unitary}
\rho_\mathrm{lost}\neq U\rho_\mathrm{L}U,\quad\forall U\in\mathrm{SU}(2),
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is the <BlogAnchor href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group" innerHTML="Lie group"/> of $2\times2$ unitary matrices with determinant 1. Furthermore, the state $\rho_\mathrm{lost}$ is no longer a pure state, but a mixed state, i.e., $\mathrm{tr}(\rho_\mathrm{lost}^2)<1$. This means that information about our original logical state, i.e., the $|\psi_0\rangle\!\langle\psi_1|$ and $|\psi_1\rangle\!\langle\psi_0|$ components, is irreversibly lost, at least without the help of a quantum erasure error correcting code.

However, there exists a theorem[@Grassl1997], which states that it is possible to use any $t$-error correcting code to correct for up to $2t$-erasure errors. The idea of using the same 5-qubit code that corrects for arbitrary single qubit Pauli errors to correct for erasure errors have been explored in my thesis [@kjwo2022] and it will be explored in my upcoming paper that's currently in the drafting stage _(stay tuned!)_. In the example by [@Gingrich2003], they demonstrated a single qubit erasure error correction using the \[\[4,2,2\]\] code, which is actually not a quantum error correcting code, but a quantum error _detection_ code, so it's pretty interesting in its own right. This paper did a tremendous job of explaining quantum erasure error correction using an \[\[_n_,_k_,_d_\]\] code. The same steps apply if you want to use the \[\[5,1,3\]\] code for erasure error correction, though there are some nuances present _(might expound on this in another post)_.

> Note that an _erasure error_ in the field of quantum error correction means that it is the loss of a physical qubit that was part of a group of physical qubits encoding a logical qubit, _but_ we know the location of the loss.

The existence of this theorem means that one could use the 5-qubit code, which corrects for arbitrary 1 qubit errors, to correct for up to 2 lost qubits!

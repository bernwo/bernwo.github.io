## Interaction of a qubit with an oscillating magnetic field

### Hamiltonian for a general magnetic field

Consider a qubit whose magnetic moment is interacting with an external magnetic field. We write the Hamiltonian of such system as such:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}=-\mu\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{B},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mu$ is the magnitude of the qubit's magnetic moment, and $\vec{\sigma}$ the vector of Pauli matrices.

### Static magnetic field with weakly oscillating transverse component

Now consider a static magnetic field along the $z$-axis with magnitude $B_0$ and a weakly oscillating magnetic field along the $xy$ plane with magnitude $B_1$. The Hamiltonian then becomes:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=-\mu\vec{\sigma}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
B_1\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\\
B_1\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\\
B_0
\end{pmatrix}
=\frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}(\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\sigma_X+\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\sigma_Y)+\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}\sigma_Z,
\label{eqn:hamiltonian-not-rotating-frame}
\end{equation}
$$

where I have used $\omega_0=-2\mu B_0/\hbar$ and $\Omega=-2\mu B_1/\hbar$. Note that $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency.

TODO: Write how this time-dependent hamiltonian doesn't result in a closed form solution to the schrodinger equation.

## Going into the rotating frame

### Rewriting the Hamiltonian for convenience

Before going into the rotating frame, we can rewrite eqn $\ref{eqn:hamiltonian-not-rotating-frame}$ by noting that $\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\equiv (e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}+e^{i\omega_\text{r}t})/2$ and $\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\equiv i(e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}-e^{i\omega_\text{r}t})/2$:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=\frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}(e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}\sigma_++e^{i\omega_\text{r}t}\sigma_-)+\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}\sigma_Z,
\end{equation}
$$

where we have also introduced $\sigma_\pm=(\sigma_X\pm i\sigma_Y)/2$ for convenience. As we move on from this, you will see that the rewritten Hamiltonian is much easier to work with when going into the rotating frame.

TODO: Ref the section above where it is said that time-dependent schrodinger equation doesnt result in a closed form solution.

### Hamiltonian in the rotating frame

To obtain the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame about the $z$-axis at frequency $\omega_\text{r}$, we introduce the following evolution operator $U=e^{-i\frac{\omega_\text{r}t}{2}\sigma_Z}$ and the formula $H_\text{RF}=U^\dagger HU+i\hbar\frac{\partial U^\dagger}{\partial t}U$. After working this formula out, you should get:

$$
\begin{equation}
H_\text{RF}=
\end{equation}
$$

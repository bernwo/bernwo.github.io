## Quantum spins and Three.js

<SimpleSpin />

As detailed in my <BlogAnchor href="/posts/simple-interactive-plot-example" innerHTML="Interactive plot"/> blog post, it is my intention to populate the site with visualisations that aid in the explanation of usually abstract concepts. My plan is to create a 3D model illustration of a _quantum spin_, which in literature, is usually portrayed in a simplified manner as a circle, with an arrow lodged in the middle.

Over the past few weeks, I have been fiddling with <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/" innerHTML="three.js"/>, which is a top-tier JavaScript library for creating beautiful and interactive 3D models on websites. It is a fairly low-leveled library compared to libraries like <BlogAnchor href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html" innerHTML="ECharts.js"/> in the sense that three.js allows you to virtually build anything you want, whereas ECharts.js is a lot easier to use, albeit limited in the things it can create.

After toiling away for about a week, I managed to build a working illustration of the quantum spin in three.js as shown above! _(Feel free to zoom in/out or pan around!)_

Since this is vaguely related to quantum computing, I included its <BlogAnchor href="/tags/quantum computing" innerHTML="tag"/> in this post.

### Shading

For aesthetics, I want the spin to have a _cel-shading_ effect which in my opinion is appropriate for scientific illustration.

I came across this <BlogAnchor href="https://spite.github.io/sketch/post-hope/index.html" innerHTML="amazing shader"/> in done in three.js, among other equally amazing shaders[^offscreencanvas]. As amazing as it is however, it is too grandiose for a simple object like a quantum spin illustration. Hence, I continued my search until I found <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_variations_toon" innerHTML="official three.js example"/> where they showcased a _toon shading_ with _outline_ effects on a group of spheres, which is perfect for my use case aesthetically. Upon checking the source code, I realised it is relatively simple, which is a cherry on top.

### Modifying the code

The source code[^webgl_materials_variations_toon_code] of the toon shading example on <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/" innerHTML="threejs.org"/> uses <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/SphereGeometry" innerHTML="SphereGeometry"/> to create a sphere within three.js. It is then obvious that I need an additional <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry" innerHTML="CylinderGeometry"/> and a <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry" innerHTML="ConeGeometry"/> to create the _'arrow'_ through the sphere to form a quantum spin illustration.

I also had to modify the code to use an <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/OrthographicCamera" innerHTML="OrthographicCamera"/> instead of a <BlogAnchor href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera" innerHTML="PerspectiveCamera"/>, since in my opinion, orthographic projections _(for the layman, this basically means it's as if a camera is focused at âˆž)_ are much better suited for scientific illustrations because it doesn't have the depth warping effects that perspective projections have.

There were also a bunch of other minor modifications, which you can deduce by comparing the code in my Github versus three.js's source code[^webgl_materials_variations_toon_code].

## Plans

After accumulating experience making this simple three.js geometry, my plan going forward is to employ this knowledge into writing a blog explaining quantum spin dynamics leveraging three.js. Stay tuned!

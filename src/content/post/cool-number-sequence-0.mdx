## Congruent numbers

Some time ago whilst researching for my Master thesis[^mscthesis], I stumbled upon a pretty cool number sequence, which goes

$$
\begin{equation}
a_n=\{0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,19,\ldots\},\label{eqn:congmod4}
\end{equation}
$$

with $n\geq0$. Do you notice what is the pattern of the sequence shown in eqn ($\ref{eqn:congmod4}$) above? If yes, congratulations! You are adept at noticing patterns! If not, that's also fine, we shall go through this together.

The pattern of the sequence is that it is just the usual non-negative integer sequence, _but every other 4 numbers are skipped!_ Now, if you're like me, you're probably wondering

> How does one even write a formula for generating such a sequence?

Well, fret not, turns out this sequence is already on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and it's sequence number A047454[^A047454], albeit offset by 1. One of the formulas given on the page is (adjusted to start from 0)

$$
\begin{align}
a_n&=\frac{1}{2}\Big(-3+(-1)^n+(1+i) (-i)^n\nonumber\\
&\phantom{{}={}}+(1-i) i^n+4 n\Big),\label{eqn:congmod4-1}
\end{align}
$$

where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. We can perform a sanity check of eqn ($\ref{eqn:congmod4-1}$) in `Python` with the following

```py
f = lambda n: (-3+(-1)**n+1j*(-((-1+1j)*(-1j)**n)-1j**n*(1+1j))+4*n)/2
[f(n) for n in range(10)]
# Outputs [0j, (1+0j), (2+0j), (3+0j), (8+0j), (9+0j), (10+0j), (11+0j), (16+0j), (17+0j)]
```

This sequence is formally known as _numbers that are congruent to $\{0,1,2,3\}\mod{8}$_.

However, I am still not quite satiated by this form because of two reasons: (1) it uses the imaginary number $i$ to produce purely real results and (2) I couldn't find a way to generalise the form to give numbers that are congruent to $\{0,1,\ldots,2^k-1\}\mod{2^k}$, which as far as I know, is a generalised sequence that is not documented anywhere.

## Generalised formula

Then, while browsing OEIS unsuspectingly, I stumbled upon the sequence A042948[^A042948], which happened to contain the following formula for generating numbers that are congruent to $\{0,1\}\mod{2}$

$$
\begin{equation}
a_n=2n - (n\mkern{-10mu}\mod{2}).\label{eqn:congmod2}
\end{equation}
$$

After fiddling around with eqn ($\ref{eqn:congmod2}$) in Wolfram Mathematica, I found out that by performing a rudimentary modification that I'd achieve what I want

$$
\begin{equation}
\boxed{a_{n,k}=2n - (n\mkern{-10mu}\mod{2^k}).}\label{eqn:congmod2k}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, with eqn ($\ref{eqn:congmod2k}$), I have obtained my holy grail for _"Cool number sequence #0"_. Now, you might be wondering,

> Hmm, is this useful in any practical applications?

This is a question that I'd like you to ponder about. But if you're impatient, then here is my answer: _yes_. One application that I found with this, without going too much into details, is performing highly efficient symmetric matrix operations (_maybe I'll talk about this in a future blog in more detail_). The prospects of other potential applications that have yet to be discovered/documented is exciting nonetheless.

## Low-level implementation

Below is a low-level implementation in `C/C++` for the curious. You can easily translate this to other languages such as Python and JavaScript since most languages use the same symbol for bit operators.

```c
// In binary algebra, you can rewrite `n mod 2^k` as `n & ((1<<k)-1)`
// where `&` is the `bit and` operator
// and `<<` is the `bit left shift` operator
int congMod(int n, int k) {
    return 2*n - (n & ((1 << k) - 1));
}
```

## Interactive plot

The first 2001 values of the sequence in eqn ($\ref{eqn:congmod2k}$) is plotted below, where $y\equiv a_{n,k}$. You can use the slider below to adjust the value of $0\leq k\leq11$ to see how the sequence changes.

## Randomised 3D bar chart

Below is an interactive 3D bar chart that I plotted using<a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block"> ECharts.js</a>. This JavaScript library uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> under the hood to render the chart that you're seeing, and thus has high performance.

<div class="echarts" id="randomised-bar3d-chart" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></div>

The data used in the plot is generated via client-sided JavaScript (see code block below), and is uniformly random, which is sufficient for a simple toy model. Thus, every time you refresh this page, the chart would look a little bit different. Here is the corresponding JavaScript code to generate the data in the format need by <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block">ECharts.js</a>

```js
// You can see this in the source code of my page too.
function generate_random_data(n) {
	return Array.from({ length: n * n }, (_, i) => [~~(i / n), i % n, Math.random()]);
}
```

## Animated 3D bar chart

Here we have a plot of the same type, i.e., 3D bar chart, but its data updates temporally. In this particular example, I'm plotting the function

$$
\begin{align}
z&=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sin{\left(\phi+\omega\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2}\right)} + 1\right),\nonumber\\
\Delta x&=x-\frac{n}{2},\nonumber\\
\Delta y&=y-\frac{n}{2},
\end{align}
$$

where $\phi$ is the phase which I chose to update every 500 milliseconds, $\omega=1/3$ is the frequency, and $n=25$ is the dimension of the plot.

<div class="echarts" id="sine-wave-bar3d-chart" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></div>

Here is the corresponding JavaScript code to generate the data in the format need by <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block">ECharts.js</a>

```js
// You can see this in the source code of my page too.
function generate_sine_wave_data(n, phase) {
	// prettier-ignore
	return Array.from({length: n * n}, (_, i) => [~~(i/n), i%n, (Math.sin(phase + (1/3) * Math.sqrt((~~(i/n) - n/2)**2 + ((i%n) - n/2)**2)) + 1)/2 ]);
}
```

Of course, a 3D bar chart is not the only way one can visualise the data. <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block">
ECharts.js</a> offers a lot of different plot types, and you can check them out <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block">here</a>.

## Why?

I've always wanted to write a blog with pedagogical elements present, and what better way to achieve that than to include beautiful visualisations that are interactive and animated. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, I looked for available JavaScript libraries that allow me to plot. There were many promising candidates, alas most of them are either missing a feature that I wanted or is too low-level. Except for <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cactus-link inline-block">ECharts.js</a>, which I found to be perfect for my use-case. Using this library has been a blast so far! ðŸ¥³.

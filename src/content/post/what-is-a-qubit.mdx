## Single qubit

The general expression of a single qubit in _computational basis_ is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
| \psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle,\label{qubit}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}$ and it must follow that the expression is normalised, (i.e. $|\alpha |^2 + | \beta |^2=1$). Computational basis refers to the fact that $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ were used to described the qubit state $| \psi \rangle$. In literature, people often instead convey the message in the following manner: _"The qubit state $| \psi \rangle$ is written using the following basis $\{| 0 \rangle,| 1 \rangle\}$"_.

Now, you may be wondering, _"what on earth is $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$?"_. Well, they are referred to what is known as "_ket 0 / ket 1_" in Dirac notation and they are basically shorthand for _vectors_ or _column matrices_. Below, we write the relationship explicitly.

$$
\begin{equation}
|0\rangle=
\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
,\quad
|1\rangle=
\begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
$$

It may seem that we need 4 degrees of freedom (which are real numbers in this case) to describe the qubit state since each of the 2 complex constants are described using two real numbers. However, by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere#Hopf_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hopf coordinates</a>, we can rewrite the expression in eqn ($\ref{qubit}$) like so

$$
\begin{equation}
|\psi\rangle=
\cos \frac{\theta}{2} |0\rangle + e^{i\phi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} |1\rangle \label{hopf}
\end{equation}
$$

where we have omitted the global phase factor $e^{i\psi}$ because it is irrelevant in the sense that it has no physically observable meaning. As we can see from eqn ($\ref{hopf}$), the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe the qubit state has reduced from 4 to 2.

From eqn ($\ref{qubit}$), we see that the possible states that our single qubit can take on is a continuum, as opposed to a classical bit, which can take on only state $0$ or $1$. It is this property which gives qubits advantage over the classical bits.

Besides the computational basis, there are also the $X$-basis ($\{| - \rangle,| + \rangle\}$) and the $Y$-basis ($\{| -i \rangle,| +i \rangle\}$), where each of these can be expressed in terms of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ as shown below

$$
\begin{align}
|-\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle-|1\rangle),\nonumber\\
|+\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+|1\rangle),
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
|-i\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle-i|1\rangle),\nonumber\\
|+i\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle),
\end{align}
$$

## Animation

The computational basis, also known as the $Z$-basis, together with the $X$- and $Y$-basis can be plotted as along the $z$, $x$, and $y$ axis in the Bloch sphere representation, respectively. An animation showing how the qubit state can be represented as a Bloch vector along the Bloch sphere (which is a unit-sphere) in 3D space can be seen below.

## Interaction of a qubit with an oscillating magnetic field

### Hamiltonian for a general magnetic field

Consider a qubit whose magnetic moment is interacting with an external magnetic field. We write the Hamiltonian of such system as such:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}=-\mu\vec{\sigma}\cdot\vec{B},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mu$ is the magnitude of the qubit's magnetic moment, and $\vec{\sigma}$ the vector of Pauli matrices.

### Static magnetic field with weakly oscillating transverse component

Now consider a static magnetic field along the $z$-axis with magnitude $B_0$ and a weakly oscillating magnetic field along the $xy$ plane with magnitude $B_1$. The Hamiltonian then becomes:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=-\mu\vec{\sigma}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
B_1\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\\
B_1\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\\
B_0
\end{pmatrix}
=\frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}(\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\sigma_X+\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\sigma_Y)+\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}\sigma_Z,
\label{eqn:hamiltonian-not-rotating-frame}
\end{equation}
$$

where I have used $\omega_0=-2\mu B_0/\hbar$ and $\Omega=-2\mu B_1/\hbar$. Note that $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency. Unfortunately, eqn $\ref{eqn:hamiltonian-not-rotating-frame}$ is time-dependent, which made it difficult to solve for the Schrödinger equation $|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{0}^{t}H(\tau)d\tau}|\psi(0)\rangle$. In fact, there is no closed form solution available. To remedy this, we are going to re-write our Hamiltonian using the rotating frame transformation.

## Going into the rotating frame

### Rewriting the Hamiltonian for convenience

Before going into the rotating frame, we can rewrite eqn $\ref{eqn:hamiltonian-not-rotating-frame}$ by noting that $\cos{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\equiv (e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}+e^{i\omega_\text{r}t})/2$ and $\sin{(\omega_\text{r}t)}\equiv i(e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}-e^{i\omega_\text{r}t})/2$:

$$
\begin{equation}
H=\frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}(e^{-i\omega_\text{r}t}\sigma_++e^{i\omega_\text{r}t}\sigma_-)+\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}\sigma_Z,
\end{equation}
$$

where we have also introduced $\sigma_\pm=(\sigma_X\pm i\sigma_Y)/2$ for convenience. As we move on from this, you will see that the rewritten Hamiltonian is much easier to work with when going into the rotating frame.

### Hamiltonian in the rotating frame

To obtain the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame about the $z$-axis at frequency $\omega_\text{r}$, we introduce the following evolution operator $U=e^{-i\frac{\omega_\text{r}t}{2}\sigma_Z}$ and the formula $H_\text{RF}=U^\dagger HU+i\hbar\frac{\partial U^\dagger}{\partial t}U$. After working this formula out, you should get:

$$
\begin{equation}
H_\text{RF}=\frac{\hbar\Delta}{2}\sigma_Z+\frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}(\cos(\varphi)\sigma_X+\sin(\varphi)\sigma_Y),
\label{eqn:hamiltonian-rotating-frame}
\end{equation}
$$

which is time-independent! It is now possible to determine via a closed form solution what our initial input state $|\psi_\text{RF}(0)\rangle$ becomes after time evolution due to our new Hamiltonian:

$$
\begin{equation}
|\psi_\text{RF}(t)\rangle=e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H_\text{RF}t}|\psi_\text{RF}(0)\rangle.
\end{equation}
$$

### Time evolution due to the Hamiltonian

On resonance, i.e., $\Delta=0$, our initial state $|\psi(0)\rangle=|1\rangle$ oscillates between $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$:

This makes sense because when $\Delta=0$, the $\sigma_Z$ term goes to zero in eqn $\ref{eqn:hamiltonian-rotating-frame}$ resulting in a rotation about some axis along the $xy$-plane. Since $\varphi=0$, only the $\sigma_X$ term survives, hence the axis of rotation is along the $x$-axis.

When off resonance, i.e., $\Delta\neq0$, our state no longer oscillates in such a way that $P_{\ket{0}}=1$ anymore due to the non-zero $\sigma_Z$ term:

		width="800"

	></img>
</div>

If you apply a $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$-pulse, then $\varphi=\tfrac{\pi}{2}$, which results in rotation about the $y$-axis instead:

In quantum computing, Rabi oscillations are crucial since they provide the basic means of manipulating the state of qubits to perform any meaningful computation.

## Appendix

### Derivation of the Hamiltonian in a rotating frame

$$
\begin{align}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi_\text{RF}(t)\rangle&=i\hbar\frac{\partial U^\dagger(t)|\psi_\text{RF}(t)\rangle}{\partial t}\nonumber\\
&=U^\dagger\Big(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle\Big)+\Big(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}U^\dagger(t)\Big)|\psi(t)\rangle\nonumber\\
&=\Big(U^\dagger HU+i\hbar\frac{\partial U^\dagger}{\partial t}U\Big)|\psi_\text{RF}(t)\rangle\nonumber\\
&=H_\text{RF}|\psi_\text{RF}(t)\rangle.
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, $H_\text{RF}=U^\dagger HU+i\hbar\frac{\partial U^\dagger}{\partial t}U$, where your rotating frame is dictated by your choice of $U$.
